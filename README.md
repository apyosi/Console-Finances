# Console Finances

## Overview
In this challenge, you’ll be using the concepts you’ve learned to complete the required activity. This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Create a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, clone it to your computer.
* Copy the starter files in your local git repository.
* A dataset have been given  composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
* Task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
* (Total/Number of months)
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* Your final code should print the analysis to the browser console - the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
